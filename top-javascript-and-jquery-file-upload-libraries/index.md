### Ingredients

Uploading files or exchanges are a daily task for any content or web developer. Every day you need to upload files of various types, (text, image or video) to the Internet. Web developers often need to write a file uploader script on your site to allow your visitors to exchange files. A file upload library can make this task much easier. In this article, we present you with the top JavaScript and JQuery file upload libraries for you to choose.

### Step-by-step

#### 1. Why Do You Need a File Upload Library?

If you are a web developer, you might think of writing your own file-sharing website or you need to complement an existing website with file-sharing functionality to allow your user to share their own files. For example, post pictures and upload their videos. There are many ways and tutorials online that can help you with that.

However, writing the code to upload images, videos, or files of any other type can be a time-consuming task. That is why you should find a solution to upload and manage files for you and allow your users a reliable sharing component as well.

Moreover, when working with a large workload of images and media files, using a file upload library can help you to streamline your uploads. Some of the advantages of using a file upload library:

*   **Saves time**—of writing your own code to upload the files
*   **Streamlines your work**—you can upload multiple files at the same time.
*   **Facilitates working with media content**—file uploading libraries come with a user-friendly dashboard, and thumbnails that help you drag and drop the images you need to upload.

While you can write your own script, when working with large workloads, it makes sense to use a file uploading library. For an effective file uploader, there are some aspects you should consider:

*   **Simple, user-friendly**—it should be clean and easy to understand with an obvious upload button.
*   **Drag and drop**—if you have a number of files, this feature can be a time-saver.
*   **A progress bar**—so the user can know the progress of the upload.
*   **Thumbnail-preview**—it is useful when working with image files allowing you to see what you are uploading.
*   **Multi-device**—a good file uploading library works across several devices so you can add images or videos from a tablet, laptop or computer.
*   **Multi-file upload**—allows you to upload simultaneously multiple files of any type, size and format.
*   **Built-in editing**—a good file uploader has built-in image editing and formatting, so you can crop, resize, change the format of an image before uploading.
*   **Multi-platform**— file uploaders allow you to fetch and drop files across social media, and use cloud storage solutions. The best solutions provide also the file storage you need.
